# External Finding Import

Use this when the user pastes findings from GitHub, Devin, CI, another reviewer, or production after a local review has already run.

## Import Steps

1. **Normalize each finding.**
   - title
   - source
   - severity if supplied
   - file/line if supplied
   - claimed failure mode
   - current-tree status: `live`, `already fixed`, `stale`, `intentional`, or `needs confirmation`

2. **Classify each finding.**
   - load `bug-class-taxonomy.md`
   - assign one or more bug classes
   - name the invariant that should have caught it
   - name the variant/sibling path that needs checking
   - if it escaped a prior clean local review, load `escaped-finding-learning.md` and name the failed review mechanism

3. **Separate action from learning.**
   - live bug: fix or keep open
   - stale: explain what current code changed and why the behavior is no longer live
   - intentional: cite product/design evidence, not just opinion
   - needs confirmation: state the exact unknown
   - all statuses: still record the missed review lens if it escaped a prior pass

4. **Write a compact import table in the review file.**

```markdown
| Source | Finding | Current status | Bug class | Missed invariant/variant | Action |
|--------|---------|----------------|-----------|--------------------------|--------|
| Devin | Batch notification partial success | live | Atomicity | mixed valid+invalid batch | fix |
| GitHub | Dead code after empty control hide | stale | Variant State | editable child empty state | no code change |
```

5. **Run a sibling search for repeated live classes.**
   - one live Authority bug means inspect other generated fields and direct callers
   - one live Compatibility bug means inspect create vs update schemas and old stored data
   - one live Affordance Parity bug means compare button, keyboard, menu, inline, and API paths
   - one live contract-key bug means inspect sibling builders, routes, form handlers, query parameters, storage keys, webhook payloads, and failure/redirect branches that serialize the same public contract
   - one live invariant-transfer bug means inspect each path created by the same authority move, including direct id hydration, scoped scans, link expansion, stream/subscription authorization, fallback pages, generated artifacts, and route error branches
   - one live stale-reference bug means inspect retained references, notifications, links, route params, subscriptions, optimistic state, caches, and deleted/tombstoned variants

6. **Handle PR-review state deliberately.**
   - if an automated reviewer has acknowledged a review request with an in-progress reaction/status, wait and poll instead of posting another trigger
   - for large PRs, compare feedback to the latest commit/SHA and local branch diff; hosted diff truncation or delayed comments are context, not proof that the finding is stale
   - after fixing an external PR finding, rerun local review/static checks, push the fix, and let the PR reviewer re-run automatically when configured
   - resolve outdated review threads only when the current tree proves the behavior is fixed and the review file records the finding as resolved
   - do not treat an outdated thread as clean evidence by itself

## Do Not

- Do not treat pasted line numbers as authoritative; inspect current behavior.
- Do not call a finding stale because the diff moved; prove the behavior is gone.
- Do not mix intentional product changes with bugs. Mark them accepted only with evidence.
- Do not fix only the pasted line when the bug class implies a sibling path.
- Do not fix only the concrete review comment after a prior local all-clear. Record why the local review missed it and what acquisition mode or invariant-transfer proof now closes the class.
- Do not post duplicate `@codex review` or equivalent triggers while a review is already running or acknowledged.
