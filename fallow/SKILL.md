  Use when adopting, configuring, running, rerunning, or interpreting Fallow
  for TypeScript/JavaScript codebase intelligence: dead code, duplication,
  health/complexity, fix previews, runtime coverage, architecture boundaries,
  CI audit gates, baselines, or Fallow-backed repo audits. Trigger when the
  user mentions Fallow, `npx fallow`, `fallow init`, `fallow audit`, unused
  exports/dependencies/files, duplication analysis, code health hotspots,
  runtime coverage, or wants a repeatable Fallow assessment workflow.

# Fallow

Use Fallow as a static-analysis signal source, then apply repo-aware judgement before changing code or policy. Fallow finds candidates; Codex decides whether to fix code, model an intentional exception in config, add a narrow suppression, or defer with a documented reason.

## Operating Rules

- Prefer full-repo adoption commands before PR-gate commands. `fallow audit` / `npx fallow --ci` is for changed-file enforcement after the repo policy exists.
- For agent consumption, prefer `--format json --quiet --explain` where supported. Use human output only for summaries intended for people.
- Treat exit code `1` as "findings reported" and exit code `2` as a tool/config/runtime error. Preserve structured JSON from finding-producing commands instead of stopping at shell failure.
- When running Fallow in shell automation, keep stderr separate from JSON stdout. Do not parse mixed human/progress output.
- Always run destructive or auto-fix operations as preview first: `npx fallow fix --dry-run --yes --format json --quiet`.
- Do not blindly accept generated config or broad suppressions. Review entries, ignores, public packages, thresholds, and baselines against the repository shape.
- Use `fallow schema`, `fallow config`, and `fallow list` as capability/introspection tools. Do not assume package scripts expose the whole analyzer surface.
- Select the analysis mode by question. Changed-file, production, semantic-duplicate, entry-export, coverage, runtime, and baseline modes intentionally mean different things.
- Parse the `actions` arrays on findings as suggestions, not instructions. Evaluate each action against repo ownership, runtime entry points, public API contracts, and verification needs.
- Determine run state from evidence. Missing `.audits/` files do not mean first adoption if config, baselines, package installation, CI hooks, or `.fallow/` artifacts exist.
- On later reruns, treat existing Fallow config, baselines, package scripts, CI hooks, and audit records as current policy/history. Focus on new regressions, stale exceptions, policy drift, and changed hotspots.
- When available, use `repo-audit` as the governance and documentation layer for repo-level assessments. If it is unavailable, still create a concise Fallow assessment record with the same core fields.
- When available, use `architecture-standards` whenever Fallow findings, config policy, or remediation touches ownership, boundaries, public APIs, shared packages, duplication abstractions, data/API contracts, runtime entry points, or hotspot refactors. If it is unavailable, apply the same boundary/ownership checks directly.
- If Fallow reveals widespread duplication, health hotspots, large-file pressure, or advisory inventories after an architecture pass, treat that as evidence the current-state diagnosis or target-state design was incomplete. Do not reduce the response to warning cleanup.
- For implementation work, prefer `architecture-standards` to decide the owning boundary and `repo-audit` to record fix batches, accepted exceptions, verification, and remaining risk, but do not block if those skills are unavailable.
- Before declaring a remediation complete, check for second-order regressions Fallow campaigns often create: test-only exports in production modules, stale coverage artifacts, duplicate test assertions, helper buckets without owners, and public contract key drift after route/helper extraction.
- Never run `fallow watch` in an agent turn; it is interactive and does not exit.

## Workflow

1. **Preflight**
   - Check for Fallow installation in package dependencies, lockfiles, package scripts, local binaries, and CI workflows before using `npx`.
   - Check for `.fallowrc.json`, `.fallowrc.jsonc`, `fallow.toml`, `.fallow.toml`, `fallow-baselines/`, `.fallow/`, `.audits/`, package manager, workspaces, framework entry points, and test/coverage scripts.
   - Discover the active analyzer surface when Fallow is present: `fallow schema`, `fallow config`, `fallow list --plugins --entry-points --boundaries`, and `fallow config-schema` when policy shape matters.
   - Check whether `repo-audit` and `architecture-standards` skills are available in the current environment before relying on them.
   - Classify the run as first adoption, configured-without-history, rerun-with-history, CI/audit-only, or remediation pass. If signals conflict, explain the inferred state and proceed conservatively.
   - If the user is only asking to build or discuss the workflow, do not install or run Fallow.
   - If Fallow must run and is locally installed, prefer the repo's package script, `pnpm exec fallow`, or the package manager equivalent. Use `npx --yes fallow ...` only when Fallow is not already available and normal tool/network approval allows it.

2. **Baseline Signal Set**
   - First adoption and broad reruns normally collect:
     - `npx fallow --format json --quiet --explain`
     - `npx fallow dead-code --format json --quiet --explain`
     - `npx fallow dupes --format json --quiet --explain`
     - `npx fallow health --format json --quiet --explain`
     - `npx fallow fix --dry-run --yes --format json --quiet`
   - Add focused commands only when the question warrants it, such as `dead-code --trace-file`, `dead-code --trace-dependency`, `dead-code --production`, `dead-code --include-entry-exports`, `dupes --mode semantic`, `health --hotspots`, `health --file-scores`, `health --coverage-gaps`, `flags`, `list --entry-points`, `list --boundaries`, or `audit --format json`.
   - Keep blocking gates separate from advisory inventories. A clean gate does not erase semantic duplicates, hotspots, coverage gaps, production-only drift, or feature-flag lifecycle work.

3. **Config Decision**
   - If no config exists and the task is adoption or policy setup, run `npx fallow init` after collecting the first signal set, then review the generated config.
   - Encode repo policy in config for real entry points, generated/vendored files, public packages, dynamic runtime entry points, intentional runtime dependencies, duplication thresholds, health thresholds, audit gate, production mode, workspaces, and boundaries.
   - Apply `architecture-standards` if available before adding boundary rules, public package policy, shared-package exceptions, production-only scope, or broad thresholds. If unavailable, explicitly reason through ownership, public API, dependency direction, and enforcement before changing config.
   - Keep exceptions narrow. Prefer config or visibility tags over repeated inline comments. Use inline suppression only for true one-off false positives.

4. **Triage Order**
   - Clear high-confidence issues first: unresolved imports, unlisted dependencies, unused files after entry-point sanity checks, then unused dependencies.
   - Use trace commands before deletion or suppression when static reachability is ambiguous.
   - Triage unused exports/types/class members by deciding whether each is dead code, public API, dynamic entry, compatibility shim, generated code, or false positive.
   - Consolidate duplication only when it reduces real maintenance risk. Avoid extracting abstractions that blur ownership or increase coupling.
   - Use `health` hotspots, file scores, and targets to prioritize review and refactoring. Do not chase every advisory candidate; preserve the distinction between gate failures and planning signals.
   - Use feature-flag findings to ask lifecycle questions: owner, default, environments, cleanup trigger, rollout risk, and verification.
   - For widespread structural findings, identify the current-state failure mode and the missing target-state rule before changing code: unclear owner, scattered policy, weak public boundary, mixed responsibility module, unowned contract, or missing fitness function.
   - Use `architecture-standards` if available for any triage item whose fix would change module placement, shared abstractions, contracts, state ownership, or public/runtime entry points. If unavailable, apply those checks directly and document the decision.

5. **Implementation Governance**
   - Before fixing, group findings by root cause and owning boundary rather than editing one warning at a time.
   - Prefer code fixes for real issues, config modeling for intentional repo policy, and narrow inline suppressions only for one-off false positives.
   - For each fix batch, state the invariant being restored, the files or package boundary that owns it, and the verification command that will prove it.
   - Rerun focused Fallow commands after each meaningful batch, then rerun the baseline signal set before calling the remediation complete.
   - If health uses coverage, refresh coverage before the final health rerun.
   - If tests import new production helpers, rerun production dead-code to ensure the helpers are real owner-local production surfaces, not test-only exports.
   - If tests were added during zero-duplication work, rerun full duplication after the tests too; duplicated assertions and setup still count under a full zero policy.
   - For broad remediation branches, keep an owner/batch ledger with command evidence and changed public contracts. Prefer smaller owner-owned PRs when possible; if one large PR is necessary, do not rely on hosted diff UI as the only review surface.

6. **Optional Branches**
   - Runtime intelligence: only when coverage exists or the user wants production execution evidence. Use the runtime workflow in `references/fallow-workflows.md`.
   - CI/PR gate: only after the repo has a policy and the team has chosen warn, baseline, or blocking rollout.
   - Baselines: use for existing debt when CI needs to block only new issues; store committed baselines outside `.fallow/`.
   - Boundaries: use when the repo has clear architecture zones or import direction rules worth enforcing.
   - MCP/agent setup: use when the user wants structured tool integration beyond shell commands.

7. **Documentation**
   - For a real assessment, write or update `.audits/fallow.md` using `repo-audit` conventions when available; otherwise use the report shape in `references/fallow-workflows.md`. If the file was deleted or missing, recreate it from current evidence and note history is unavailable.
   - Record run-state evidence, command set, Fallow version when available, config state, blocking gates, advisory inventories, exceptions and reasons, highest-risk findings, remediation order, verification, and residual risk.
   - Preserve enough state for later comparison: config summary, category counts, top findings, and optional raw JSON locations when useful.
   - On reruns, prepend a new turn and compare against previous Fallow state when available: new, resolved, accepted, deferred, deployment-gated, inventory-only, stale suppression, and policy-drift findings.
